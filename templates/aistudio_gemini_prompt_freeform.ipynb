The primary objective of firms is to maximize their profits, which is defined as revenue minus costs.\n\n\n2. The difference between the short-run and the long-run from the perspective of production theory is that in the short-run, some inputs are fixed, while in the long-run, all inputs are variable.\n\n\n3. All of the listed options are properties of isoquants.\n\n\n4. A production function in which doubling all inputs causes output to more than double is known as increasing returns to scale.\n\n\n5. In the short run, the marginal cost is defined as the wage rate multiplied by the number of hours needed to produce one additional unit.\n\n\n6. An isocost line is defined as combinations of labor and capital that yield the same levels of cost.\n\n\n7. The economically efficient point of production for firms is identified by the tangency of an isoquant with an isocost line.\n\n\n8. The example of McDonald’s demonstrates the concept of labor becoming less productive, not capital. This occurs in a short-run analysis. In a long-run analysis, both capital and labor are variable, as both can be changed. With the two isoquants given, if capital becomes less productive as the business expands, the slope of the long-run expansion path will decrease as output increases, or as L increases. This means the firm will become more capital-intensive with more expansion. The long-run expansion path would be concave.\n\n\n9. The cost of a law school education would be considered sunk costs. This is because these are expenses that can not be recovered once you have graduated law school.\n\n\n10. Short-run choices are 1, and 3. Long-run choices are 2, 4 and 5.\n\n\n11. In the long-run, all inputs are variable. Since fixed costs are defined as costs that do not vary with the level of output, there can be no fixed costs in the long run. \n\n\n12. The manager should assess whether each worker is worth less than the previous workers by using the marginal product of labor. After calculating the value of each worker and calculating the cost of an additional worker, the manager can then evaluate the options of increasing the number of workers or adding machines.\n\n\n13. Adding a 19-year-old student to the class will decrease the average age from 23.7 years. This is an example of diminishing marginal product. The average value decreases as each marginal value is added.\n\n\n14. Barry Bond’s career home run average increased after the 2001 season. His performance increased his home run average. This is because the marginal value (73 home runs) was higher than the average value (33 home runs). The average increases with each marginal value if the marginal value is higher than the average value.\n\n\n15. If the firm is at the minimum point of its average cost curve, that means the marginal cost is equal to the average cost. The firm would not alter the size of its plant unless the prices of the inputs changed.\n\n\n16. The difference between average total cost and average variable cost decreases with each unit of production, because the average fixed costs decrease with each unit of production, and therefore decreases the difference between average total cost and average variable cost.\n\n\n17. This information is not covered in the lecture clip.\n\n\n18. Out of the listed firms, you would expect diseconomies of scale to set in at relatively low levels of output for the restaurant, copy shop and newspaper. This is due to higher fixed costs, which need to be spread out amongst many units of production, and also due to the diminishing marginal returns of labor that result from a lack of machines to aid in production.\n\n\n19. As car repair shops require more computerized testing equipment to repair newer cars, the long-run average total cost curves will likely rise, as the increased use of technology increases costs.\n\n\n**NUMERICAL PROBLEMS:**\n1. \n1. The marginal product of the second janitor is 4 classrooms.\n2. The average product of four janitors is 4 classrooms.\n3. The addition of the third janitor is associated with decreasing marginal returns because the marginal product of labor is less than the previous marginal product. \n4. The addition of the fourth janitor is associated with decreasing marginal returns because the marginal product of labor is less than the previous marginal product.\n5. The addition of the seventh janitor is associated with negative marginal returns because the total product decreases as a result.\n6. The image can’t be provided since the video did not show the drawing process.\n7. The slope of the total product curve is the marginal product of labor. Therefore, the slope values are 3, 4, 5, 4, 1, 0, and -1.\n8.\n1. The marginal product of labor increases when the slope of the total product curve is positive and increasing.\n2. The marginal product of labor decreases when the slope of the total product curve is positive and decreasing.\n3. The marginal product of labor is negative when the slope of the total product curve is negative.\n\n\n2. The total cost is $150,000.\n\n\n3. The error in the director’s recommendation is that she included overhead costs. Overhead costs are a type of sunk costs, which should not be included when making decisions about production.\n\n\n4. \n1. The average fixed cost of cleaning three classrooms is $33.33.\n2. The average variable cost of cleaning three classrooms is $33.33.\n3. The average fixed cost of cleaning seven classrooms is $14.29.\n4. The average variable cost of cleaning seven classrooms is $28.57.\n5. The marginal cost of cleaning the seventeenth classroom is $100.\n6. The average total cost of cleaning twelve classrooms is $33.33.\n\n\n5. The information provided is insufficient to sketch the curves. The variable costs of publishing magazines are labor, paper and ink, electricity and marketing. Fixed costs are printing presses and building rent.\n\n\n6. The calculations are complex and can’t be provided without more detailed information.\n\n\n7. \n1. The image can’t be provided, since the video did not show the drawing process.\n2. The image can’t be provided.\n3. The cost per knife is decreasing in the region of the long-run average cost curve that corresponds to economies of scale.\n4. The cost per knife is constant in the region of the long-run average cost curve that corresponds to constant returns to scale.\n5. The cost per knife is increasing in the region of the long-run average cost curve that corresponds to diseconomies of scale.\n\n\n8. If the marginal product of capital is 60 and the price of capital is $6, and the marginal product of labor is 20 and the price of labor is $2.50, the firm should increase the amount of labor and decrease the amount of capital used. This is because the bang-for-the-buck of labor is 8, while the bang-for-the-buck of capital is 10. Therefore, the firm can achieve a greater marginal product per dollar using capital.\n\n\n9. The price of labor must be $5 per unit.\n\n\n10.\n1. The marginal product of capital must be 100.\n2. The firm would become more labor-intensive since capital becomes more expensive to use relative to labor. \n\n\nI hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions."
